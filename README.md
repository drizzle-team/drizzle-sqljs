# drizzle-sqljs

This is a demo of the Northwind dataset, running on [Drizzle ORM](https://driz.li/orm) + [sql.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/) + [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) in your browser
This dataset was sourced from [northwind-SQLite3](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3), UI design from [Cloudflare D1 example](https://northwind.d1sql.com).
You can use the UI to explore Supplies, Orders, Customers, Employees and Products, or you can use search if you know what you're looking for.

```shell
npm i
npm run dev
```
